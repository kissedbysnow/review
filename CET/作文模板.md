1. 解决方法型

   解决方法题型要求考生列举出解决问题的多种途径：
   
   1. 问题现状
   
    	2. 怎样解决（解决方案的优缺点）

	```
		In recent days,we have to face the problem-----(描述问题A),which is becoming more and more serious.First,----(说明A的现状).Second,------(举例进一步说明现状)
	Confronted with A,we should take a series of effective measures to cope with the situation.For one thing,------(解决方法一).For another--------(解决方法二).Finally,----(解决方法三).
   	Personally,I believe that -----(我的解决方法).Consequently,I'm confident that a bright future is awaiting us because-----(带来的方法).
   ```

2. 说明利弊型

   这种题型往往要求先说明一下现状，再对比事物本身的利弊，有时也会单从一个角度（利或弊）出发，最后往往要求考生自己表明自己的态度（或对事物前景提出预测）。

   1. 说明事物现状

   2. 事物本身的优缺点（或一方面）

   3. 你对现状（或前景）的看法

      ```
      	Nowadays many people prefer A because it has a significant role in our daily life.Generally,its advantages can be seen as follows.First----(A的优点之一).Besides----(A的优点之二).
      	But every coin has two sides.The negative aspects are also apparent.One of the important disadvantages is that----(A的第一个缺点).To make matters worse,----(A的第二个缺点).
      	Through the above analysis,I believe that the positive aspects overweigh the negative ones.Therefore,I would like to---(我的看法).
      	From the comparison between these positive and negative effects of A,we should take it reasonably and do it according to the circumstances we are in.Only by this way,-----(对前景的预测).
      ```

3. 阐述主题型

   要求从一句话或一个主题出发，按照提纲的要求进行论述。

   1. 阐述名言或主题所蕴含的意义

   2. 分析并举例使其更充实

      ```
      	The good old proverb-----(名言或谚语)reminds us that-----(主题含义).Indeed,we can learn many things from it.
      	First of all,-----(理由一).For example,----(举例说明).Secondly,-----(理由二).Another case is that----(举例说明).Furthermore,----(理由三).
      	In my opinion,------(我的观点).In short,whatever you do,please remember the say---(主题或名言).If you understand it and apply it to your study or work,you'll necessarily benefit a lot from it.
      ```
